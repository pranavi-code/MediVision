0,chestagentbench\images,"Based on the chest X-ray in Figure 1, which of the following statements accurately describes the observed pulmonary findings and their implications for the patient's condition?
A) The nodular infiltrates are predominantly in the right lung, with cavitation present only in the larger nodules.
B) The nodular infiltrates are evenly distributed across both lungs, with cavitation present in both smaller and larger nodules.
C) The nodular infiltrates are more prominent in the left lung, with cavitation seen exclusively in the left lower lobe nodules.
D) The nodular infiltrates are primarily located in the lower lobes of both lungs, and cavitation is more frequent in the nodules associated with the right lung.
E) The nodular infiltrates show a predilection for the upper lobes, and no cavitation is visible in the X-ray.
F) The nodular infiltrates are more numerous in the right lung, with cavitation present in both the right and left lung nodules.",B,error: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled,error: torch not compiled with cuda enabled,0.0,1.0
1,chestagentbench\images,"A 34-year-old female patient with a history of IV drug abuse presents with fever and worsening dyspnea. Her admission chest radiograph shows multiple bilateral nodular infiltrates with variable size and occasional cavitation. Based on the chest X-ray findings alone, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Bacterial pneumonia
B) Pulmonary metastases
C) Septic pulmonary embolism due to tricuspid valve endocarditis
D) Wegener’s granulomatosis
E) Thromboembolic disease
F) Foreign body embolism",C,error: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled,error: torch not compiled with cuda enabled,0.0,1.0
2,chestagentbench\images,"Based on the chest X-ray findings in Figure 1, which of the following statements best supports the diagnosis of septic pulmonary embolism in this patient?
A) The presence of bilateral nodular infiltrates with cavitation suggests metastatic disease.
B) Bilateral nodular infiltrates without cavitation are consistent with pneumonia.
C) The presence of cavitated nodules, especially in the lower lobes, combined with a history of IV drug abuse, is indicative of septic pulmonary embolism.
D) The absence of pleural effusion rules out septic pulmonary embolism.
E) The nodular pattern with cavitation suggests foreign body embolism.
F) The cavitated nodules are more likely indicative of Wegener's granulomatosis.",C,error: Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled,error: torch not compiled with cuda enabled,0.0,1.0
